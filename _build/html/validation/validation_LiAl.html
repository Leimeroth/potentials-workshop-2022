<p>Once we have the fitted potentials, it is necessary to validate them in order to assess their quality with respect to applications.</p>
<p>In this exercise, we use the fitted potentials and perform some basic calculations.</p>

<h3>Define the important pases to consider for validation<a class="headerlink" href="#define-the-important-pases-to-consider-for-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We construct a python dictionary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">struct_dict</span></code> which contains a description of all the important phases that we want to consider for this exercise. The descriptions given in the dictionary will be later used by Pyiron to generate or read the structural configurations for the respective phases.</p>
<p>For unary phases, we provide an initial guess for the lattice parameter and use pyiron to generate the structural prototype.</p>
<p>For binary phases, we provide a phase name and an additional dictionary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fl_dict</span></code> which maps the phase name to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.cif</span></code> file saved in a subdirectory.

<h2>(a) Ground state: E-V curves<a class="headerlink" href="#a-ground-state-e-v-curves" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Using a series of nested <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops, we calculate the murnaghan EV-curves using all three potentials for all the defined structures.</p>
<p>We loop over:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All the potentials defined in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">potentials_list</span></code> and name the project according to the potential</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All the chemical formulae defined in the keys of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">struct_dict</span></code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>All phases defined for a given chemical formula</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the loops, the first step is to get the structure basis on which we will perform the calculations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For unary phases, we use the pyiron function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pr_pot.create_ase_bulk(compound,</span> <span class="pre">crys_structure,</span> <span class="pre">a=compound_dict[&quot;a&quot;])</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>For binary structures, we read the basis using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pr.create.structure.ase.read(fl_path)</span></code> with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fl_path</span></code> given by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fl_dict</span></code> defined earlier.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the structure and potential is defined as part of the pr_job, we run two calculations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job_relax</span></code> to relax the structure to the ground state</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">murn_job</span></code> to calculate the energies in a small volume range around the equilibrium</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the calculations are being performed, the status(s) of each calculation is printed. If a job is already calculated, the calculations are not re-run but rather re-read from the saved data.</p>

<h2>(b) Elastic constants and Phonons<a class="headerlink" href="#b-elastic-constants-and-phonons" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Pyiron also has job modules to calculate elastic constants and thermal properties using the quasi-harmonic approximation given by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">phonopy</span></code> package.</p>
<p>As in the previous task, we again loop over the defined potentials and then over the given structures.</p>
<p>Calculating elastic constants and thermal properties is considerably more expensive than calculating EV curves. Hence, it is useful to only calculate these properties for a subset of most important structures</p>
