Instructions from Sarath how to setup pyiron environment:


Dear All,

I have attached an environment file based on the binder setup for pyiron_atomistics as Sudarsan suggested. 
I also added calphy, so everything should work. 

You can use the following commands:

conda env create -f env.yml

conda activate workshop

python -m ipykernel install --user --name workshop

Now the workshop should appear as a kernel in the jupyterlab. Hopefully everything works well.
